## cloning instructions
clone the repository and work on a separate branch from main, only push to main code that is tested and working.


## coding standards
we are using the following standard [Kotlin code Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) (_please be sure to comprehend the conventions ðŸ‘ˆ to simplify collaboration_)

## code organisation
code for **UI** will be in the *"view"* package, while code for backend will be in the *"model"* package, and code for business logic will be in the *"controller"* package.
_If by now you do not know yet what a package is, please read/ google/ youtube/ even chatgpt can help_

The application uses a thin client server architecture, for authentication we used firebase API, for maps we used Google Maps API. Please when cloning make sure the APIs are configured correctly!
